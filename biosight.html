<h2>Dating-Marriage</h2> <img src="images/dating.JPG "alt="dating"style="position: relative;
border: 3px solid rgb(39, 16, 75);">
<p>Drew and Becky first met nearly 10 years ago. Facebook was fairly new and there was a dating application that was similar to Tinder, before Tinder was a thing. People would look at profile pictures, send winks to each other, and exchage messages. This is how they first were introduced to each other.  Drew and Becky connected, exchanged phone numbers and began trading text messages. Eventually they met up at the Gateway Mall in Salt Lake City, Utah by the water fountain and decided to grab some sushi and see a movie. Drew and Becky dated for two years before getting happily married on November 11. </p>


<h3>Running</h3> <img src="images/shoes.jpg" alt="shoe" style="position: relative;
border: 3px solid rgb(39, 16, 75);">
<p>One of the things that makes Becky unique her love of running. When it comes to running, the shoes make all the difference. To save your feet from wear and tear you want the right amount of tread. In fact, what is recommended is to change your running shoes out at every 300-500 miles. Trail running means you have to watch your form. American Trail Running is a site you can go to for good inspiration and articles on trail running. <a href="https://trailrunner.com/">trailrunner.com</a>.</p>


<h4>Nutrition</h4> <img src="images/myplate.jpg" alt="myplate" style="position: relative;
border: 3px solid rgb(39, 16, 75);">

<p>In addition to being a runner Becky is a licensed Dietitian. Her motto is “No two people are the same, so there is not one specific diet or lifestyle that will work for everyone. Hence the need for someone with a master’s degree in nutrition/dietitics to cater to the individual’s dietary needs. As a basic setup to help be healthy remember to follow my plate at <a href="https://www.choosemyplate.gov/">www.choosemyplate.gov</a> which can inspire you to learn more about your meals.</p>
